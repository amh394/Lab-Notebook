ECSE 395 Week 2

1/22: This week we held our needfinding interview with our stakeholder, who gave us a good idea of what he needs done. Sanzhar took meeting minutes. We also assessed the group's availability for regular meetings every week. Next week we hope to begin brainstorming, as well as reach out to our stakeholder to schedule subsequent meetings for any extra questions that may come up throughout the design process.
